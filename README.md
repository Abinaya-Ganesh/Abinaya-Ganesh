I'm Abinaya, a Data Scientist.

I am a passionate data enthusiast who made a deliberate decision to upskill in the field of Data Science to pursue a career that truly resonates with my interests and aspirations. I recently completed a 6-month certification in Advanced Programming Professional and Master Data Science through GUVI Geek Networks Pvt. Ltd., an Ed-tech company incubated by IIT-M. During this program, I gained proficiency in Python and other essential data-related skills, guided by experienced mentors. The hands-on projects I completed provided me with valuable practical experience that complemented the theoretical knowledge I acquired


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently upskilling myself on Tableau
- ğŸŒ± I am now seeking a role as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist where I can apply my skills and contribute to the success of both the organization and my own professional growth.
- âš¡ My key skills include Python, SQL, Pandas, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Power BI, and Streamlit.
